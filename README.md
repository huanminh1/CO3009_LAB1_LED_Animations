# MICROCONTROLLER - MICROPROCESSOR  
## LABORATORY 1: LED ANIMATION

This project is the first lab designed to get familiar with **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)** using the STM32F103C6 microcontroller.  
The main focus is implementing **LED Animations** through multiple exercises.

## 1. Schematic
The code was simulated in **Proteus 8** using STM32F103C6.
